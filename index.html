Our Goal and Misson 
  <br>
  Our company started with a seemingly simple goal: creating an allergy safe catering company to alleviate the stress associated with eating at social gatherings. 
  <br>
Our Story 
  <br>
  Our founder, Priya Sharma, faced this challenge for years, always feeling alienated when it came time to celebrate life's biggest moments with food. 
  <br>
  Rather than feeling a sense of togethernees, Priya had to skip family meals, worry about accidental exposure to allergens, and feel alone during events that should've been full of joy.
  <br>
  Growing up, she missed out on many things that kids her age would normally enjoy due to her nut and gluten allergies. 
  <br>
  Priya recognized the importance of creating an inclusive meal environment and made it her life's mission to ensure that no one with allergies would feel excluded in social settings. 
  <br>
  What began as a one woman operation in Priya's small Chicago apartment has now blossomed 
How We Operate 
  <br>
  We strive to bring allergy safe eats at reasonable prices.
